In this article, we will create a multi-step progress bar. A Multi-Step Progress Bar is a user interface element created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It guides users through a series of steps or stages, visually displaying their progress and allowing step-by-step navigation in a multi-step process or form.

Final output
prog-1

Prerequisite
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Approach
Create a multi-step form structure with HTML and style it using CSS.
Use JavaScript to handle step transitions, progress tracking, and button interactions.
Add event listeners to the “Next” and “Previous” buttons for step navigation.
Update the progress bar width and active step indicator as users navigate.
Toggle the visibility of fieldsets to show the current step and hide others.
Implement a “Finish” step to indicate completion of the multi-step process.
 
Example: This example illustrates the creation of a basic Multi Step Progress Bar using HTML, CSS, & JavaScript.
